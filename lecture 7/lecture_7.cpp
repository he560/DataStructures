-> Summation of n^2
    Note: Summation can be used to express sums of inc exponents.
    --> The largest integer that can be represented ...
    --> 1+2+4+8+...+(2^n)-1= (2^n)-1

-> But Why though...?
    --> Ideally, we want our algorithms to run in linear or n-log-n
        time. Algorithms with quadratic or cubic running times
        are less practical.
-> Floor and Ceiling Functions
    --> Floor Function[x] = the largest integer <= x
    --> Ceiling Function[x] = the smallest integer >= x
-> Analysis of Algorithms
    --> Factors impacting the running time:
        -> Hardware environment
        -> Software environment.
    --> Running time depends on the input size...
